# A strawpoll web application

This Spring-based application creates a strawpoll website at
`http://localhost:8080` where users can add votes to or remove then from
options, but also create entirely new options for the poll.

## How to build
[source, shell]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:chlewe/strawpoll.git
$ cd strawpoll
$ mvn clean package
----

## How to use
[source, shell]
----
$ java -jar target/strawpoll-{VERSION}.jar
----

If you are running this on a webserver, you might want to set up a reverse proxy
to port 8080.
